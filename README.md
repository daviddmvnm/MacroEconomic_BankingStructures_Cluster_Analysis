# **Macroeconomic Volatility and Banking Structure in High-Income Economies (Group 3)**

This analysis examines how banking structure affects macroeconomic stability in high-income economies. The results indicate that more competitive and fragmented banking markets (Cluster 1) are associated with lower volatility in investment and inflation.

---

## Objectives  
- Apply K-Means clustering to group high-income economies by banking structure.  
- Investigate whether banking competition impacts macroeconomic volatility.  
- Interpret how financial system characteristics affect investment and inflation stability.

---

## Key Findings  
- **GDP growth volatility** is similar across clusters — banking structure has little influence on growth stability.  
- **Labour force participation volatility** is low and nearly identical — minimal direct impact on labour markets.  
- **Gross capital formation volatility** is moderately lower in Cluster 1 — suggesting more stable investment cycles in competitive markets.  
- **Inflation volatility** is significantly lower in Cluster 1 — indicating more effective monetary transmission and price stability.  

 The last two findings are statistically significant based on T-tests.

##  Interpretation  
In developed economies with mature capital markets, banking structure appears to influence **investment** and **price stability** rather than **growth** or **employment**.  

- **Cluster 0** (concentrated markets): Greater systemic control, but less flexible in responding to shocks.  
- **Cluster 1** (competitive markets): Better at absorbing risk and smoothing credit/inflation cycles.
